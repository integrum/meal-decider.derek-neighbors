### Purpose: 
Use Meal Decider when you want to quickly and unanimously decide where or what to eat as a group/family
	
### Steps: 
1. Proposer says "I propose we eat `location` or `meal` for `meal`"
1. Proposer says "1-2-3"
1. Voters,using either Yes (thumbs up), No (thumbs down), or Support-it (flat hand) vote.
  * If you vote No (thumbs down) you have to issue a new proposal starting at step 1
  * If more than one No (thumbs down) vote exists, any of the No votes can issue a new proposal

### Commitments:
* Proposal must reference a specific location (dining out) or meal (dining in)
* Remain present until the Decider protocol is complete; always remain aware of how your â€¨behavior either moves the group forward or slows it down. 
* Give your full attention to a proposal over and above all other activity. 
* Speak only when you are the proposer or are directed to speak by the proposer. 
* Keep the reasons you voted as you did to yourself during the protocol. 
* Only vote No (thumbs down) if you have a different idea.
* Do not argue with an absolute no voter.
* Actively support the decisions reached. 
* Do not pass during a Meal Decider. 

### Examples:
* "I propose we eat Joe's BBQ for lunch"
* "I propose we eat frozen pizza for dinner"
